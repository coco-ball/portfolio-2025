        BrachiosaurusesðŸ¦•!
        <br />
        <br />
        Iâ€™m currently studying Visual Communication Design and Information
        Science and Culture at Seoul National University. Also, Iâ€™m working at
        LogiSpot, where I design digital logistics systems that support
        integrated operations.
        <br />
        Previously, I worked at Vive Studios, where I designed UI components and
        responsive designs for AI products and the SaaS platform VIT, with my
        work applied directly to the final product.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iâ€™ve taught myself web development and collaborated with developers on
        real-world products, which helped me build a solid understanding of how
        things get builtâ€”and how to communicate effectively across disciplines.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of my favorite hobbies is creating interactive websites that offer
        aesthetically rich and dynamic experiences.
        <br />
        Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve built several personal projects and
        participated in interactive web studies, always exploring how to craft
        interfaces that feel both intuitive and unexpectedly delightful.
