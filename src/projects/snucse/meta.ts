  description:
    "This project was a complete renewal of the official website for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University. Our team, CSEREAL, consisted of six developers and two designers. As one of the designers, I worked closely with the development team to plan, design, and implement a fully functional website with over 120 pages. This project provided valuable experience collaborating across disciplines and contributing to a large-scale, real-world service.",
